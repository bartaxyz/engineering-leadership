# Introduction

Being an impactful engineering manager can be tough and sometimes vague. You'll be working in vastly different conditions. At one point in time, you'll be fighting mountains of technical debt, and at another, the main concern will be interpersonal conflicts. A manager's job can be so different in two different contexts that many will even have trouble understanding what you do in your day-to-day.

That's the main problem this book is going to attempt to tackle. How to be the most impactful manager you can be, in any given situation that's thrust your way. It would be a lie to say that this book can give you a recipe for everything you'll encounter in your career. Nobody will ever give you that. Instead, this book will attempt to give you an opportunity to learn from others, in the same way the other people learned through their managers or peers before that.

## Why write a book, and why this format?

One of the best tools in the toolbox of a manager is communication. Putting this into practice, consistently writing,Â reading & discussing with your peers (engineers & managers alike) becomes critical for your growth. Even if you solely write in your personal journal, it's still a great habit. But writing your journal in public, letting others contribute, and later publishing it has the potential to fast-track your development even further. That was the motivation for starting this project.

This book is published as a public repository on Github [^1], letting others contribute. Who can contribute and how will always be up to date over there. Generally speaking, there'll always be someone who'll need to check every contribution. But anyone can open an issue or a pull request with their desired changes, and they'll be honestly discussed by the maintainers & the community.
