# To Code Or Not To Code

Stepping into management, you'll often hear that you need to give up coding at work altogether. Many engineering managers (if not most) come from software engineering backgrounds. And the best managers, that I had, were also previously very impactful individual contributors themselves. While it's true for the most part that you'll have to give up coding, there are some good arguments for preserving your coding skills sharp.

As a manager, your job is to make sure to set the team up for success in the longer term. This means that individual contributions to the codebase could be limiting your overall impact on the team and the product. That wouldn't be good. So while coding might be beneficial in various ways, individual contributions to the codebase should seldom, if ever, be your aim.

## Good Reasons To Code

Believe it or not, there are many benefits you may get from getting personally involved in the development process. What's important, though, is that you don't lose the picture of what's your job. It's not to contribute directly with code. It's to work with your team, make their lives better, make sure they stay efficient and happy, and assure they are able to keep up with the pace that's expected of them.

Now let's dive a litter deeper into the specific reasons & benefits of actively coding, as a manager.

### Spotting Inefficiencies Firsthand

When you get actively involved with the codebase, you'll be able to witness directly what's the delivery process like for the engineers. If there are any inefficiencies, you'll experience them firsthand.

Especially if you get back to the codebase after some time of not coding, you can look at everything with very fresh eyes. If you're not already using onboarding process for spotting inefficiencies.
